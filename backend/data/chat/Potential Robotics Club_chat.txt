We believe the best way to learn is by doing (theory classes are for sleeping only 🥱🤐), so we curate workshops, hackathons and hands-on project builds to learn together—updates on all of these will be shared here.
If you need help with a project (not budget-related, we’re just as broke as you 🙄), drop a message! If not a club member, someone with experience will surely respond (hopefully – pretty sure everyone has their fair share of being left on ‘seen’😂😂). That said, if we do come across project proposals that truly stand out, we’ll do our best to support them - even if it means pulling a few strings ₹₹.
Looking forward to building, learning and maybe putting out a few burnt components along the way. Welcome aboard!

7/23/25, 9:32 PM - Aditya: On behalf of our entire team, *404 Team Not Found,* we would like to extend our heartfelt thanks for organizing Project Showcase 3.0.

Participating in this event has been an incredibly enriching experience. It not only gave us a platform to present our project but also helped us deeply reflect on how to structure and convey our ideas effectively. We’ve gained valuable insights into what we missed, how to refine our presentation skills, and how to prepare better for future opportunities.

Winning 2nd place is a great honor for us — but more importantly, the learning we received through this event was priceless. Thank you for the opportunity, your support, and for hosting such an inspiring initiative.

Looking forward to many more such events!
